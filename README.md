**Project Title:** 
**Deploying Node.js Application on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)**

**Project Description:**

**EC2 Instance Setup:**

Launched an EC2 instance using Ubuntu as the operating system.
Configured the EC2 security group to allow inbound traffic on necessary ports (SSH for access, HTTP for web traffic, and the app's custom port).
**Node.js Installation:**

Installed the required version of Node.js and npm on the EC2 instance to ensure the environment was ready to run the application.

**App Deployment:**

Deployed the Node.js application to the EC2 instance by cloning it from the Git repository or transferring the files directly.
Installed all the necessary dependencies for the application to run properly.

**App Configuration and Execution:**

Configured the app to listen on a specific port and ensured it ran smoothly in the background, even after system reboots, using appropriate process management tools.
Network and Firewall Configuration:

Ensured the EC2 instance’s security group allowed traffic to the app’s port, making it publicly accessible.

**Public Access Setup:**

Assigned a public IP to the EC2 instance, ensuring that the application was accessible from a web browser at the public IP and port.
Testing and Validation:

Verified the functionality of the deployed application by checking its accessibility via the public IP and ensuring it responded as expected to HTTP requests.

**Skills Gained:**
EC2 Instance Management: Gained hands-on experience with launching and managing EC2 instances on Ubuntu.
Node.js Deployment: Learned the process of deploying and configuring a Node.js application in a cloud environment.
Security Configuration: Developed skills in configuring security groups and controlling traffic flow to ensure secure hosting of the application.
Process Management: Gained knowledge in managing background processes to ensure the app runs continuously.
Networking and Access Configuration: Learned how to configure network settings to ensure public access to the application while maintaining security.
